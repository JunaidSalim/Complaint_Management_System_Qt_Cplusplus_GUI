**Introduction**<br>
The Application Management System (AMS) developed by our team is a GUI-based application designed to facilitate efficient communication between students and teachers. It consists of two interfaces—a student login and a teacher login—providing specific functionalities tailored to their respective roles.

**Functionality Overview**<br>
⦁	Application Creation: Students can create applications within the system, which are then sent to the teacher for review.<br>
⦁	View Sent Applications: Students can also view the status of applications previously submitted.<br>
⦁	Login Validation: Students access the system using their registration number, ensuring secure authentication.<br>
⦁	Login Credentials: Teachers log in using a username and password for access control.<br>
⦁	Application Review: Teachers can view applications submitted by their students, having the ability to accept or deny them using radio buttons, facilitating a streamlined approval process.<br>
⦁	Student Management: Teachers have options to add new students to their class and delete existing ones, maintaining class records efficiently.<br>

**Applications and Benefits**<br>
The LMS offers several benefits for effective communication and management within an educational environment:<br>
⦁	Streamlined Application Process: Students can easily submit applications, and teachers can efficiently review and respond to them.<br>
⦁	Centralized Communication: It provides a centralized platform for communication between teachers and students, streamlining interactions and reducing administrative overhead.<br>
⦁	Student Management: Teachers can manage their class roster effectively, adding or removing students as needed.<br>
⦁	Secure Authentication: The login system ensures security by allowing only registered students to access the platform.<br>
<br>
**Team Contributions**<br>
⦁	Muhammad Taimoor: Led the backend coding using Qt Creator in C++, spending around 15 hours on the project.<br>
⦁	Junaid Saleem: Contributed significantly to file handling implementation and integrated it into our custom widget-based application. Also, developed the major portion of the GUI.<br>
⦁	Hamza Faraz: Focused on enhancing the GUI's visual appeal and usability, improving the overall user experience.<br>
⦁	Muneeb Bin Nasir: Contributed by offering design improvement ideas and working on the technical documentation for the project.<br>
<br>
**Project Development**<br>
⦁	Time Invested: Collectively, the team dedicated over 20 hours across multiple sessions spanning 2-3 days to complete the project.<br>
⦁	Collaborative Effort: Taimoor's extensive backend work was supported by Junaid, while Hamza and Muneeb focused on the visual aspects and documentation, respectively.<br>

**Conclusion**<br>
The Application Management System developed by our team presents a comprehensive solution for effective communication and management between teachers and students. Its intuitive interface and functionalities streamline application processes and facilitate secure, centralized communication within an educational setting.<br>

Note: The application's success is attributed to the collective effort and collaboration of all team members—Taimoor, Junaid, Hamza, and Muneeb—who contributed their expertise to develop a robust and user-friendly system.<br>
